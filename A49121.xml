            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>ST. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> ſays, that <hi>the Pſalms are ſo
compoſed as to repreſent the caſe and condition of every man.</hi> And
though I thought it impoſſible to find in ſacred or prophane Hiſtory a
fit Parallel for this horrid Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy, yet by a few meditations on this
Pſalm, our preſent Caſe appeared to be ſo fully deſcribed, as if the
Royal Prophet had penned a Prophecie of our times, rather than a Hiſtory of
his own; there being ſcarce a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable circumſtance in the riſe,
growth, diſcovery, or defeating of the one, which hath not a parallel line in
the other: whether we conſider Gods many miraculous deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances of the
King, the Kings exceſſive Clemency to an unworthy People, or that Peoples
deplorable ingratitude both to God and the King. Nor was there more of the
Malice of the Devil and unreaſonable men in contriving, nor of the Mercy of
God in defeating the Conſpiracy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt King <hi>David,</hi> than in this
againſt King <hi>Charles;</hi> which by that time the Parallel is drawn, will
ſo appear, that <hi>all that ſee it ſhall ſay, This hath God done,</hi>
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Title doth not declare the occaſion of the Pſalm, which
conſiſts of Prayer and Praiſe, and is directed <hi>to the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:53041:4"/>chief Muſician,</hi> to be ſet as a holy Anthem to
perpetuate the memory of a gracious deliverance from a formidable Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my that
ſought after his life. It is not agreed who this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy was. Dr.
<hi>Hammond,</hi> with ſome others, think it to be <hi>Saul;</hi> but the
whole contexture of the Pſalm expreſſeth the Rebellion of
<hi>Abſolon</hi> and <hi>Achitophel</hi> ſo fully, that there is not a
thread wanting or miſplaced. It is a Rule with Expoſitors, that <hi>where
the Title of the Pſalm is defective, it ought to be referred to the preceding
Pſalm,</hi> wherein, <hi>v.</hi> 11. the Prophet gives himſelf the Title of
<hi>King,</hi> which he never did while <hi>Saul</hi> was alive, and therefore
ſome very learned Expoſitors conclude that it was written <hi>(contra
Achitophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem &amp; Collegas ejus)</hi> againſt <hi>Achitophel</hi> and his
Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates.</p>
            <p>Inſtead of a Comment on the Text, I ſhall onely joyn the two
authentick Tranſlations together, and there will need no other Expoſition;
for thus it runs: <hi>All men ſhall ſee it</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> the
Iniquity of the Conſpiracy, and the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Judgments of God on the
Conſpirators) <hi>and fear, and ſhall declare the work of God, ſaying,
This hath God done: for they ſhall perceive that it is his work, and ſhall

ever the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were till they were ſetled in
<hi>Canaan.</hi> And 'tis no leſs a wonder, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo good a King had
been ſo long in the Throne (which was well-nigh forty years) and God had done
ſo great things for him, and he for God, his Church, and the true Religion,
againſt all Oppoſition; when for Plenty and Peace, Laws and Liberties,
Religion, and all neceſſary helps to Devotion and true Piety; when for ſo
long a time there had been <hi>no decay no leading into captivity,</hi> but
<hi>their Sons did grow up as young Plants, and their Daughters were as the
poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed corners of the Temple,</hi> that there ſhould be any
<hi>complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in their ſtreets:</hi> Much more, that the People ſhould

            </p>
            <p>King <hi>David,</hi> v. 4. is called a <hi>perfect</hi> man; not
that he was exempted from humane infirmties, but as to the main: he was a
Prince choſen by God out of all the Tribes and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> endowed with all Royal vertues of Fortitude, Wiſdom, and
Clemency, that might qualifie him for Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; <hi>a man after Gods own
heart,</hi> who minded the building of Gods houſe more than his own: for in
the midſt of all his troubles, when he was driven to ſhift for himſelf
from one place and Kingdom to another, he gave the Prieſts a ſpecial charge
to ſecure the Ark of God, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.25. And it was his good will to
Sion, that created him ſo much ill will from his and Gods Enemies: they were
for <hi>Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles</hi> at <hi>Hebron,</hi> he for the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity</hi>

ſupported it. No Prince ruled more ſtrictly by the Laws of God, and the
Statutes of <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> than <hi>David:</hi> Pſal. 78.73. <hi>He fed
them with a faithful and true heart, and ruled them prudently with all his
power.</hi> The greateſt imperfection in <hi>David</hi>'s government, was his
too great indulgence to ſuch as <hi>Abſolon</hi> and <hi>Shimei,</hi> who
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed it, to an attempt of his overthrow: for he granted to ſome who had
been his profeſſed Enemies, more Favours, Priviledges, and Dignities, than
other munificent Princes have done to their approved Friends.</p>
            <p>This good King is ſaid, <hi>v.</hi> 4. to be thus perſecuted
while <hi>he thought himſelf ſecure, Nil tale metuentem.</hi> His
Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence was his chief Guard; which cauſed him to expoſe himſelf in all
places, among all ſorts of perſons: having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved well of all, he
ſuſpected none: Whatever Clamours were noiſed againſt him, he was not
conſcious of any guilt of Arbitrary government or Oppreſſion, or any
deviation from the eſtabliſhed Worſhip of God to Idolatry; though in the
time of his baniſhment among idolatrous Nations, he met with ſuch
Temptations, as none but <hi>a true Iſraelite, in whoſe ſpirit there is
no guile,</hi> could reſiſt. Yet wanted there not ſome <hi>that
ſlandered the footſteps of Gods anointed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The beſt men are leaſt ſuſpicious: it is Impiety and Guilt
that multiplieth Fears and Jealouſies, and makes men froward and impatient:
Malefactors are always Enemies to thoſe that have the power to puniſh them,
knowing they cannot be ſafe, but by diverting their Governours from the
execution of the Laws. The beſt Princes, like the beſt men, have uſually
the moſt Enemies, as will appear in</p>
            <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> Parallel, the perſons joyned in the
Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy.</p>
            <p>Wherein <hi>Achitophel</hi> was the firſt Mover, and the great
Wheel that gave motion to all the reſt. A treacherous falſe Brother, as his
name ſignifies, <hi>Frater defectus vel ruinae:</hi> That perſon to whom
<hi>David</hi> had reſpect, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 41.9. <hi>My<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53041:5"/>own familiar friend in whom I truſted, which did eat of my bread,
hath lift up his heel againſt me.</hi> Wherein he was a type of
<hi>Judas</hi> that betrayed his Lord and Maſter. He was (as <hi>Tacitus</hi>
ſays of <hi>Sejanus</hi>) <hi>facinorum omnium repertor;</hi> the ſpirit
and life of that wicked <hi>Aſſociation,</hi> which from its firſt
conception was impregnated with an <hi>Aſſaſſination.</hi> He had been
a long time <hi>David</hi>'s <hi>Counſellor,</hi> as he is call'd by way of
Eminency, the chief Miniſter of State: He was preferred, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi>
27.33. before <hi>Huſhai,</hi> though he is ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the kings friend
and companion;</hi> before <hi>Jehoiada</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biathar,</hi> and
<hi>Joab</hi> the Kings General. He had been intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted with the <hi>Arcana
Imperii.</hi> A man of great Experience, and no leſs Subtilty: he knew the
Intrigues of all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and of all the
neighbouring Princes; and by his compliance had inſinuated into the
affections of them all ſo, that he drew them all into an Aſſociation with
him: <hi>Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek, the Philiſtins, and them that dwell at
Tyre.</hi> He had the art of uniting them to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who never could agree
with one another: With all theſe, <hi>the Counſel of Achitophel was as if
they had enquired at the Oracle of God;</hi> and no wonder, for it was ſo
with <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Abſolon</hi> alſo. He had ſeen divers
Revolutions of the Government <hi>(Quorum pars magna fuit.)</hi> from
<hi>Saul</hi> to his Son <hi>Iſhboſeth,</hi> from <hi>Iſhboſeth</hi>'s
ſhort Reign to <hi>David;</hi> and now he ſets up for <hi>Abſolon:</hi>
and who would not confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate with the Kings Son, having the Kings great
Counſellor on his ſide!</p>
            <p>We cannot find any cauſe given by <hi>David</hi> for
<hi>Achito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phel</hi>'s Revolt, who had been obliged by all the Favours that a
potent and proſperous Prince could heap on a well-deſerving Subject: and
therefore muſt impute it to his own ambitious and reſtleſs ſpirit: for
a right <hi>Gilonite</hi> he was, a Revolter and Renegade from Party to Party,
as his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and ungovernable ſpirit led him. Perhaps the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Prince had rejected ſome of his raſh Counſels, his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming and
ingroſſing the ſole power of making War and<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53041:6"/>Peace, his
violating well-eſtabliſhed Leagues, his <hi>Delenda Carthago,</hi> his
courting the Affections of the People, aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them from their Prince,
ſowing Seeds of Diſcontent and Sedition among them. For impatient he was of
any Diſcontent, or Corrival in the Kings favour; he never did nor could, in
all the Revolutions, endure a Superiour: for when he endeavoured to aſſume
the Command of <hi>Abſolon</hi>'s Forces to himſelf, (as we read, 2
<hi>Sam.</hi> 17.1,2. <hi>I will chuſe out</hi> 12000 <hi>men, and will up
and follow David,</hi> (i. e.) he would have headed the Rebellion, and left
<hi>Abſolon</hi> to ſhift for himſelf) his deſigne being fruſtrated
by the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable advice of <hi>Huſhai,</hi> it ſo grated on his
Spirit, that he could find no reſt but in his Grave. Evident it is, that his
grand deſigne was to have broken the Chain of Succeſſion to the Crown of
<hi>Iſrael:</hi> and though he pretended to ſet up <hi>Abſolon,</hi> yet
it is apparent that his aim was to aſſume the Government to himſelf: for
when he perceived that <hi>Abſolon</hi> was perſwaded to command his own
Forces in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and in open Field, and not cowardly to aſſaſſinate
his King, being unarmed (which one of his moſt daring Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains refuſed to
do) he quite deſerted young <hi>Abſolon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know that ſome Divines tell us that <hi>Achitophel</hi> was
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed againſt <hi>David</hi> by a revengeful ſpirit for the ſake of
<hi>Bathſheba,</hi> who was the Daughter of <hi>Eliam,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi>
11.4. and <hi>Eliam, Achitophel</hi>'s Son, <hi>chap.</hi> 23.34. But here lies
a Myſtery: <hi>Chileab,</hi> old <hi>David</hi>'s ſecond Son, was yet
alive, though ſome would have him dead; he was to be excluded from the
Succeſſion for <hi>Abſolon</hi>'s ſake, as is pretended: but that Chain
being broken, though but in one link, the whole would be laid aſide as
<hi>uſeleſs and burthenſom;</hi> and then, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<hi>Abſolon</hi>'s pretence, the Crown might have deſcended to his own
little <hi>Solomon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what if <hi>David</hi> were guilty in the matter of
<hi>Bathſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba?</hi> our <hi>Achitophel,</hi> of all men living, was unfit to
revenge that ſin on his Soveraign, of which he was ſo notoriouſly guilty
himſelf, who, as an old Fornicator, having conſumed<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53041:6"/>his
own ſtrength on ſtrange Women, having inceſtuouſly abuſed the Mother
and Daughter, as ſome modern Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians report, did, alſo (to cut off
all hopes of a Reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation between the Father and Son) perſwade
<hi>Abſolon</hi> to <hi>go in to his Fathers Concubines,</hi> and that <hi>in
the ſight of all Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael;</hi> than which, as <hi>Sanctius</hi> ſays, the
Devil himſelf could not have given a more pernicious Counſel, nor, if he
had been incarnate, done a viler act. And by this time the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil was entred
into the heart of <hi>Achitophel,</hi> and drove him furiouſly to
deſtruction, and <hi>(quod facis, fac cito)</hi> his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of riſing
ſuddenly, <hi>that very night,</hi> with his <hi>twelve thouſand Brisk
Boys,</hi> and falling on <hi>David, while he was weak and weary,</hi> to
ſeize his perſon, and <hi>ſmite him onely,</hi> knowing that in him who
was the breath and life of all his Loyal Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, they would all be as the King
was, but dead men, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.2, and 3.</p>
            <p>This deſigne, I ſay, when it was brought to the birth, though
at firſt it pleaſed <hi>Abſolon and all the Elders of Iſrael,</hi> v.
4. yet on ſecond thoughts they all abhorred the bloudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that
execrable deſigne; and God heard the Prayer of <hi>David,</hi> and the
Supplications which were inceſſantly made for him, and confounded that
deviliſh device, <hi>turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the counſel of Achitophel into
fooliſhneſs;</hi> who being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted of all his Confederates, deſerts
himſelf too; and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing that <hi>Abſolon</hi> would be defeated, and
all his own evil Arts and Impoſtures laid open; his ſuborning falſe
Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, his encouraging ſeditious Petitions, his lying Slanders
againſt the Lords Anointed, his obſtructing the execution of Juſtice, and
acting arbitrarily againſt the Loyal Party; he becomes deſperate, and
thinks of nothing but going (with <hi>Judas</hi>) <hi>to his own place,</hi> as
the Text ſays, <hi>he went home and hanged himſelf.</hi>

            <p>His firſt great Engine was the debauching of <hi>Abſolon,</hi>
one of the Royal Bloud, a perſon too well qualified for ſuch an unnatural
deſigne; who being of a bloudy and ambitious ſpirit, was not ſatisfied
with the death of <hi>Amnon</hi> his eldeſt Brother, but ſought his Fathers
life too. <hi>Achitophel</hi> having baited the Hook with the preſent hopes
of the Crown, the poſſeſſion whereof would expiate the greateſt
Villanies, as his Polititian had informed him, was eaſily inſnared. Him our
<hi>Achitophel</hi> took into his tuition; and too great a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient he was
in all the evil Arts of his Tutor; by whoſe Methods he courted the People
ſo ſucceſsfully, as in a ſhort time he was the Idol of the People: for
the Vulgar are led by Senſe and <hi>Raree Shows,</hi> a flattering Tongue,
and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Aſpect; for all which, <hi>there was none like Abſolon,</hi>
2 Sam. 14.25. <hi>As for beauty</hi> (&amp; multum egregio decus enitet ore:)
<hi>in all Iſrael there was none to be ſo much praiſed as Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolon;
from the ſoal of whoſe foot to the crown of his head, there was no
blemiſh.</hi> And as his Beauty was attractive of Love, ſo the ſymmetry,
ſtrength, and activity of body<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53041:7"/>fitted him for Arms and
Action: and of his perſonal Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and daring Spirit, he had given the
people ſufficient proof: his natural Advantages and Abilities were poliſhed
and ſet off with all imaginable arts of Courtſhip and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigable
Induſtry. For <hi>he roſe up early and ſtood by the way of the gate</hi>
(where Judgment was to be given) to meet and encourage ſuch Petitioners as
<hi>Achitophel</hi> ſent thither with Complaints: <hi>And it was ſo when
any came to the King for judgment, Abſolon called them to him, and,</hi>
without more ado, <hi>ſaid, Thy matters are good and right, but there is no
man deputed of the King to hear thee. O that I were made judge in the land,
that every man that hath any ſuit or cauſe, might come to me, and I would
do him juſtice!</hi> 2 Sam. 15.2,3,4. But he did not onely <hi>verba

he returned the complement</hi> threefold; he <hi>put forth his hand,</hi> and

<hi>v.</hi> 5. and as if he would breathe his very Soul into theirs, he
whiſpers to them his ſence of their Grievances, and promiſes Redreſs:
He condoles the defects of his Fathers Government, who through old Age and new
Delights was wholly indiſpoſed for the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſo great a People,
which was now devolved on corrupt Magiſtrates and a carnal Prieſthood, by
whom <hi>judgment is turned into gall, and the fruit of righteouſneſs into

<note place="margin">Ineſt omni populo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignum quid &amp;

People, who are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver better pleaſed, than when they hear well of
themſelves, and ill of their Governours.</p>
            <p>And now <hi>Abſolon</hi> is more the Peoples Darling than ever
he was his Fathers; he and his Adherents are the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots and
<hi>Saviours</hi> of their Country: <hi>all the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are out of
courſe,</hi> and <hi>they alone bear up the pillars of it:</hi> His Fame is

<hi>Abſolon</hi>'s Graces and Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, for which his Soul was more

was oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and ready to expire, through the growth of Tyranny and
Idolatry.</p>
            <p>And now <hi>look to thy ſelf, David;</hi> the hearts of thy
Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are <hi>ſtollen</hi> from thee, and it is no difficult matter to
em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy their hands to take the Crown from thy head. Theſe Alarms awaken
<hi>David</hi>'s Spirit, and put him into a <hi>great ſtreight</hi> between
his Fatherly affection to <hi>Abſolon,</hi> and his own preſervation, in
which that of his People was bound up; and this later prevails againſt the
former: <hi>Abſolon</hi> is <hi>baniſhed</hi> for the ſpace of <hi>tw
years</hi> from the preſence and Dominions of his Father, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi>
14.28. during which time he <hi>ſaw not his fathers face;</hi> but by the
mediation of <hi>Joab, David</hi>'s General, he was reſtored again to
ſavour, being ſo paſſionately beloved of him, that <hi>the heart of
David longed to go out to him</hi> in his Exile, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.39. And
<hi>ch.</hi> 14. <hi>v.</hi> 33. in token of perfect reconciliation, his Father
<hi>kiſſed him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Rebellion is as the ſin of Witchcraft,</hi> from which
few or none are thorowly reclaimed; no Merit, Mercy, nor Miracles, can reduce
them to a ſtedfaſt Loyalty: for though <hi>Abſolon</hi> was pardoned for
ſome almoſt-unpardonable crimes, yet even from hence he takes encouragement
to conſpire againſt his Father.

               <hi>David</hi>'s too great Indulgence to <hi>Abſolon,</hi> was the occaſion
of his, and had like to have been ſo of his own ruine. <hi>Becauſe judgment

            <p>For though by an Act of Oblivion, and many Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the Coals
of Diſcontent and Sedition ſeemed to be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked up; yet by a factious Party
that <hi>Achitophel</hi> left behind him, they were ſo blown up, and
ſcattered through the whoſe Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that nothing but
the wiſdom and<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53041:8"/>power of God could prevent a general
Conflagration. For the flame that ſeemed to be extinguiſhed by
<hi>Abſolon</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, and <hi>Achitophel</hi>'s Death, was but
confined, and breaks forth with greater violence than ever. <hi>Abſolon</hi>

conſidering that they would at length fall on their own heads, as

            </p>
            <p>This hath ever been the practice of rebellious perſons,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53041:9"/>to chalk out that way with their Tongues and Pens, which
they intend to cut out with their Swords. But if indeed any ſuch Offenders

of the wiſeſt and beſt men in the Nation have given them an excellent
Example, and it would be their happineſs to imitate them. For I dare aver,
that there are more Arguments for reſiſting of lawful powers, which they
cannot but know is threatned with <hi>Damnation,</hi> Rom. 13.2. in the books
of ſome who term themſelves <hi>true Proteſtants,</hi> than in all
thoſe which are written by ſuch as they juſtly condemn for
<hi>Idolatrous</hi> and <hi>Traiterous Papiſts.</hi> Let any of them read
over all <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>'s Letters, as printed by Authority, and extract the
moſt dangerous Poſitions for Rebellion in them; and I dare parallel all of
them in one Book of a Leading Diſſenter, which he yet ſtiles his <hi>Holy
Commonwealth.</hi> With what face can theſe men pretend any longer that they
cannot through Scruples of Conſcience come up to the Church of
<hi>England</hi> in the practice of an innocent Ceremony, who have outgone the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> as well in the practices as in the principles of
Rebellion and Bloudſhed!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:53041:10"/>The ſecond Conſpirator was <hi>Sheba</hi>
the Son of <hi>Bichri,</hi> of whom <hi>David</hi> was the more afraid,
becauſe he came <hi>Sobrius ad evertendam Rempub.</hi> 2 Sam. 20.6. <hi>Now
ſhall Sheba do us more harm than did Abſolon.</hi> But notwithſtanding
his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Sobriety, the Text calls him <hi>a man of Belial:</hi> and
as it is ſaid, when one mad Dog bites another, and that a third, they all run
mad; ſo the Venom of <hi>Achitophel</hi>'s tongue infected all that
converſed with him with perfect madneſs: for who but a mad man would kick
at the Crown of <hi>David,</hi> and think to make a Foot-ball of it to be
toſſed by every Clown? Yet this the vertuous and noble <hi>Sheba</hi>
at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted: He <hi>blew the trumpet</hi> againſt the Succeſſion, 2
<hi>Sam.</hi> 20.1. <hi>We have no part in David, neither have we inheritance
in the ſon of Jeſſe: every man to his tents, O Iſrael.</hi> And
<hi>mighty numbers of the men of Iſrael withdrew from David to follow Sheba;
except the men of Judah, who clave unto their King.</hi> So great a Party had
he formed in the City <hi>Abel,</hi> that it was like to have periſhed with
him: but by good advice <hi>his head was cut off,</hi> and ſo that Miſchief
prevented, 2 <hi>Sum.</hi> 20.22. Yet this great man thought to do as
<hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> to pull down the <hi>Pillars</hi> of the State, and to
<hi>ſlay more at his death than he had done in his life-time:</hi> and as if
it had not been enough to draw others into the ſame Perdition with himſelf
in his life-time, heacted ſo as to <hi>make Iſrael to ſin</hi> after his
death. For what man that pretends to be a <hi>true Proteſtant,</hi> would
think it more eligible, and <hi>thank God that he died by the Ax,</hi> being
condemn'd as a Traytor, than to go to Heaven <hi>in flames of fire</hi> for the
true Religion, if it had pleaſed God to call him to a fiery trial?</p>
            <p>The next perſon (among <hi>David</hi>'s Enemies) was that Churl
<hi>Nabal,</hi> who was of the houſe of <hi>Caleb;</hi> that <hi>Caleb,</hi>
I ſuppoſe, of whom it is written, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.24. that he was a man
of <hi>another ſpirit, who obeyed God and ſerved his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant Moſes
fully.</hi> And by the bleſſing of God, and the Kings bounty, he became a
very great man, and had large poſſeſſions, all which were preſerved
to him by <hi>David,</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:53041:10"/>1 Sam. 25.21. <hi>I have kept all
that this fellow hath in the wilderneſs, ſo that nothing was miſſing of
all that pertained to him.</hi> Now <hi>David</hi> being in diſtreſs, he
ſent <hi>ten young men to greet him in his name; Peace be to thee, and peace
be to thy houſe, and peace be to all that thou haſt: we come in a good
day,</hi> a day when <hi>Nabal kept a feaſt like the feaſt of a king:</hi>
and his requeſt is very mean; <hi>Give, I pray thee, to Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid and his
ſervants whatever cometh to thy hand.</hi> This was extremely modeſt, where
all was owing, to intreat ſo ſmall a pittance; and there was extreme folly,
as well as ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, in denying a little portion to him that could have
commanded all. Yet hear the Anſwer of this Churl, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.10.
<hi>Who is David, and who is the ſon of Jeſſe? ſhall I take my bread,
and my water, and my fleſh, and give it to men that I know not whence they
be?</hi> At which Anſwer <hi>David</hi> was greatly provoked, being thus
rewarded evil for good, <hi>v.</hi> 21. and <hi>railed on,</hi> v. 14. by him
who had been <hi>a will unto him both by night and day, that none did hurt
him,</hi> v. 16. for which he was ſentenced to death. But pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably he might
have obtained pardon from <hi>David,</hi> if he could have pardoned himſelf:
but at the very hearing of the Sentence, <hi>his heart died within him,</hi> v.
37. <hi>and he became as a ſtone;</hi> and within ten days after he was found
dead.</p>
            <p>The next Character of the Conſpirators is that of <hi>Ziba,</hi>
who was a ſervant of the houſe of <hi>Saul,</hi> as his Father had been, in
the firſt War againſt <hi>David;</hi> a wealthy man he was too, but a great
part of his wealth was raked together by falſe Informations, ſubtile
Inſinuations, and Sequeſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. As he never loved the King himſelf,
ſo he hated all thoſe that did love him. <hi>Mephiboſeth</hi> the Son of
<hi>Jonathan, David</hi>'s old and faithful friend, gave order to <hi>Ziba</hi>
to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare his Aſſes that he might wait on the King in his diſtreſs;
but as he complains, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.26. <hi>Ziba deceived him,</hi> and yet
he had the confidence to accuſe his Maſter in a high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, <hi>ch.</hi>
16.3. as if he <hi>tarried at Hieruſalem,</hi> with a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to make a
Party for himſelf againſt <hi>David,</hi> and had<pb n="16" facs="tcp:53041:11"/>ſaid, <hi>To day ſhall the houſe of Iſrael reſtore me the
Kingdom of my Father.</hi> By ſuch ſlanderous ſuggeſtions many of
<hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s moſt loyal Subjects were rendred ſuſpected of the
People, as Penſioners to a forraign power, Promoters of an Arbitrary
Government, and evil Counſellors. And ſo ſubtile and importune were the
Informers in their Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that <hi>David</hi> was inclined to believe
them rather than <hi>Mephiboſeth,</hi> who had been a great ſufferer and
hearty ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower for him, <hi>ch.</hi> 19.24. <hi>He had neither dreſſed
his feet</hi> (being lame in them both) <hi>nor trimmed his beard, nor
waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his clothes, from the day the king departed, until the day he came
again in peace:</hi> and ready he was to part with all that he had, though to
<hi>Ziba</hi> himſelf, for the preſervation of the publick peace: <hi>yea,
let him take all, for as much as my Lord the King is come to his houſe in
peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Ziba</hi> was a fellow-ſervant in the houſe of
<hi>Saul,</hi> with <hi>Doeg</hi> the Edomite; that <hi>Doeg</hi> who at the
command of <hi>Saul</hi> fell on <hi>Abimelech</hi> and the reſt of <hi>the
Prieſts of the Lord, and ſlew in one day fourſcore and five perſons
that wore the linen Ephod; and their wives, and their children, and
ſucklings, and all their cattle, he ſlew with the edge of the ſword,</hi>
1 Sam. 22.18. And wherefore ſlew he them? but onely for their fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity to
<hi>David,</hi> becauſe they <hi>gave him victuals,</hi> and
<hi>aſſiſted him with a ſword, and prayed to God for him,</hi> v. 10.
when he was perſecuted by <hi>Saul.</hi> A cruelty which none of
<hi>Saul</hi>'s <hi>Footmen</hi> would execute, <hi>v</hi> 17. but theſe
<hi>children of Edom, in the day of the diſtreſs of Hieruſalem and Sion,
cryed out, Raze it, raze it, even to the foundations thereof,</hi> Pſal.
137.7. <hi>Ziba</hi> was a principal Perſecutor of the Church of God next to
<hi>Doeg;</hi> he countenanced the Meetings at <hi>Hebron,</hi> and was a
Patron to thoſe <hi>mock-Prieſts</hi> which ſacrificed there, in

Cauſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The laſt of the Conſult was <hi>Amaſa,</hi> whom
<hi>Abſolon</hi> made Captain of his Hoſt; a perſon of a turbulent and
ambitious ſpirit, who could not be obliged by any favour, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitly
beyond his deſerts: his deſign was to have ſupplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Joab,</hi> and
to have been made <hi>David</hi>'s General; and <hi>David</hi> had made him a
promiſe, <hi>ch.</hi> 19.13. but was willing firſt to have ſome proof of
his fidelity: and, <hi>ch.</hi> 20.4. he gave him command to <hi>aſſemble
the men of Judah,</hi> and to purſue <hi>Sheba</hi> at a ſet time; but he
delayed the buſineſs, and diſappointed <hi>David:</hi> yet ſtill he
intruded himſelf, and would fain lead the Forces raiſed by
<hi>Abiſhai;</hi> ſo that his ambition became ſo intolerable to
<hi>Joab,</hi> that <hi>he ſmote him in the fifth rib, and ſhed out his
bowels,</hi> v. 10.</p>
            <p>Having ſeen the Characters of the men,</p>
            <p>We are now, in the <hi>third</hi> Parallel, to conſider their
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, the matter of Fact, the Means and Methods of carrying on the
Conſpiracy, which in <hi>v.</hi> 2. is deſcribed to conſiſt of two

inſurrection of evil doers.</hi> The Prophet prays God in the firſt place,
<hi>Adverſus occulta conventicula nocentium hominum;</hi> as
<hi>Rudinger</hi> interprets it. The Aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſination of the King, which
as you have heard, was deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Achitophel,</hi> but prevented by his
own death, was now undertaken by a ſecret Cabal, who narrowly watched every
ſtep that he made, in his going forth, and in his coming in; in his
buſineſs, and in his recreations, at home and abroad; but ſtill the
wonderful Providence of God fruſtrated them: for as <hi>Pallas</hi> hid her

the Almighty hide his <hi>David under the ſhadow of his wings,</hi> that

which, being at a fault, ſearch every Buſh and every Path; and
compaſſed Sea and Land to lay hold on an opportunity; on the River in his

Journey to and from <hi>Newmarket</hi> and <hi>Hampton-Court:</hi> yet, as in 2
<hi>Sam.</hi> 8.14. <hi>God preſerved David whitherſoever he went.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Never was a Partridge ſo hunted from Mountain to Mountain as
<hi>David</hi> was. Parties were formed in every City and County, to drive him
into their toils; in Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations and Conventicles, by Nonconformiſts and
Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts too; among whom, ſome accuſed him of Perſecution, and
pleaded for <hi>reſiſtance,</hi> and dealing with him as a <hi>Julian,</hi>
an Infidel and Apoſtate; and omit nothing that the wit of men, inſpired by
the malice of Devils, could contrive to perfect this execrable Parricide. At
length the Monſter was come to its birth; but by the bleſſing of God it
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved abortive: For as <hi>David</hi> complains, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 140.5.
<hi>The proud have laid a ſnare for me, and cords; they have ſpread a net
by the way ſide, and ſet grins for me.</hi> They were infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that the
King was to return from <hi>Newmarket</hi> on the Saturday, and they were ready
for the execution on the Friday: the way-ſide was ſpread, not with Cords
and Nets, but Carts and armed men. And now they thought him ſure: for
<hi>who, ſay they, ſhall ſee?</hi> v. 5. <hi>perſecute and take him,
for there is none to deliver him; there is no help for him in his God:</hi> for
<hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>they encouraged one another in this evil matter:</hi> the
Devil was <hi>a lying ſpirit in the mouths of their Prophets,</hi> though
they were <hi>transformed into Angels of light,</hi> perſwading the
Aſſaſſinates that they ſhould do God an acceptable Service in killing
his Anointed, and be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured as the deliverers of their Country, and do as
meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious a work as the deſtroying of ravenous Beaſts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:53041:12"/>Now what greater encouragement can be given
men pretending to Religion and Conſcience, than when their Guides, to whom
they have committed the conduct of their Souls, ſhall <hi>Propheſie lies in
the name of God,</hi> and urge them to Rebellion by Scripture and Examples? And
whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be not a juſt Judgement of God on thoſe Regicides, who for
above Thirty years together have ſhewn no token of repentance for murthering
the beſt of Kings, to give them up to the hardneſs of their own hearts,
that they may <hi>fill up the meaſure of their iniquities,</hi> by attempting
the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous butchering of him that was ſecond to none but his
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Father, I wiſh they would conſider. Beſides, the Laws of
the Land, as well as Gods, were made a noſe of Wax, and wreſted to the
acquitting of the Guilty, and condemning the innocent, by <hi>Ignoramus
Juries,</hi> and <hi>ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Witneſſes,</hi> by Tumults and Riots, and
being thus poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by a ſpirit of obſtinacy, they are like him

            <p>Barbarous and ever-to-be-abhorred was that deteſtable Parricide

Mount <hi>Nebo,</hi> within ſight of the Promiſed Land, and, as the Rabbins
ſay, with a Kiſs of Gods Mouth that drew up his Spirit. But for ſuch
Varlets to aſſaſſinate a Prince in an inſtant, coming from his
Recreation, not fearing any ſuch thing, having deſerved well of all men;
this was like the <hi>Italian</hi> malice, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to ſlay his Enemy
Body and Soul. Certainly King <hi>James</hi> ſpake as a Prophet when he told

for the King was not to periſh alone; they meant him a more noble attendance

of Martyrs.</hi> It was <hi>Achitophel</hi>'s advice, <hi>the man whom thou

Members muſt periſh with it, <hi>Ch.</hi> 17.3. So that it was not ſome
<hi>Small Stirs,</hi> as they minc'd the matter in a Scotiſh Dialect, but
<hi>a general In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection.</hi> The great City where <hi>Abſolon</hi> had

Aſſembly of ill-aſſected Nobles and Gentry were invited thither; the
City wanted not men nor Magazines of Arms; the men wanted not Courage nor
Malice. They expected onely the Signal, and then all the City had been once
more in a flame, and filled with the ſhout of <hi>God ſave King</hi>
Abſolon. Nor was the Country much behind the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in preparation for the
Inſurrection: <hi>Abſolon</hi> had made frequent excurſions into every
part, and had <hi>ſetled Spies</hi> and Correſpondents <hi>in all the
Tribes of</hi> Iſrael, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.10. where-ever he came, he was
received with acclamations of joy, and worſhipped as the riſing Sun, the
redeemer of <hi>Iſrael</hi> from Tyranny and Idolatry; King <hi>David</hi>
himſelf, nor <hi>Solomon in all his glory</hi> was more ſplendid: yet our
<hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolon</hi> exceeded him; he had but 50 men of all that great City to
run before him, ours had 1500 in this little City: and how many of the Gentry
waited on him, and careſſed him, is not yet to be ſpoken. Inſomuch that
<hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> had even done what our King was adviſed to do, to leave the
Government as he loved his life; <hi>David</hi> himſelf cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him King,
<hi>Ch.</hi> 16.16. and <hi>Huſhai, Davids friend,</hi> cries <hi>more than

ſo many of the people did adore him. And with ſo great concern were
Elections canvaſed through the Nation, as if a Prize were to be plaid for the

the Kings Ships, the <hi>Gunpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-Treaſon</hi> in a Blunderbuſs, the
<hi>Iriſh Maſſacre</hi> in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, the <hi>Scotiſh
Rebellion</hi> in <hi>Argile,</hi> and the <hi>Votes</hi> and
<hi>Ordinances</hi> of Forty One, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the Bill of Excluſion.
And now I ſuppoſe the Parallel is ſo well drawn, that <hi>he that runs

<hi>Abſolon,</hi> is outdone by our Modern Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians.</p>
            <p>But it will be objected againſt what hath been ſaid, That it
was not the Body of <hi>Diſſenters</hi> that were engaged in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> Horrid Conſpiracy, but onely a few
Malecontents, or men<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53041:14"/>of deſperate fortunes, and ſome of
them lived in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and were
religious and godly men.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, 1. The ſame Objection was made by the
Papiſts concerning the Powder-Treaſon, that they were men of broken
Fortunes, and were not permitted the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of their Religion, which they
valued beyond their Lives: yet it is well known, that <hi>Digby</hi> and others
of them were men of Eſtates; that the execution of the Penal Laws againſt
them was generally ſuſpended, and they enjoyed equal priviledges and
favours with other Subjects: and though all of that Perwſaſion were not
privy to it, yet it is evident they would have approved of it, and rejoyced in
it, if it had ſucceeded; becauſe though it were defeated, the Deſigne was
approved at <hi>Rome;</hi> and a Prieſt of that Church, who was proved guilty
of the Conſpiracy, and ſuffered for it, was honoured as a Martyr. Now if
the Principles allowed of in any Community of men, do coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance the
reſiſting, depoſing, and murthering of Princes, be it on pretence of
Hereſie or Tyranny, or for the good of the Kirk, reforming Abuſes, or
redreſſing Grievances; though there be but a few Actors, yet all are
Criminals; and, in the ſence of the Law, there are no Acceſſories in the
caſe of Treaſon.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly, a Secret of ſuch conſequence could not be
intruſted with all the Faction; it was enough that their Principal Guides and
Leaders were engaged in it; where ſome performed the Function of the Brain,
to conſult; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Eyes, to ſearch out Opportunities and
Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages; others of the Ears and Tongue, to liſten after and ſcatter
falſe Reports, as ſo many Fire-brands; others of the Hands, to execute
ſuch traiterous deſigns: the whole Body was certainly engaged, and without
all peradventure would at leaſt <hi>(poſt factum)</hi> have rejoyced in it,
as they did of the moſt deteſtable Murther of the Royal Martyr; when a
Repreſentative Body of theſe <hi>Diſſenters</hi> layed a foundation
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53041:15"/>for ſuch an ungodly Enterprize; when they had even
bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the King alive, and by falſe Inſinuations ſtoln away the hearts
of the People, and deprived him of the Comforts and neceſſary Supports of
his Crown and Dignity, voting his Guards to be a Grievance, and the executing
the Penal Laws on Diſſenters to be grievous to the Subjects, an
En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to Popery, and dangerous to the Peace of the Kingdom; when he
was denied to raiſe Money on his own Revenues, and ſuch as ſhould
aſſiſt him pronounced Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the Peace of the Nation; when a
conſiderable part of his Cuſtoms were taken from him; the Bill for
excluding the lawful Succeſſors was reſolutely inſiſted on, and a
Vote paſs'd for reſtoring the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> to his Offices; for
which, application was to be made to the King by ſuch Members of Parliament
as were of the Kings Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil: when it was voted that all who ſhould
oppoſe the Bill of Excluſion, ſhould be dealt with as Betrayers of the
King, the Proteſtant Religion, and the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> and
Penſioners of <hi>France:</hi> when one pronounced it a favour that the Duke
was onely excluded, and another would have perſwaded him to deſtroy
himſelf, and a third threatned that rather than not exclude him, they would
<hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the whole Glorious Family of the</hi> STUARTS:<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Hunt.</hi>
               </note> when ſeditious Petitions were
promoted, and the Thanks of the Houſe voted to be given to a ſeditious
Party of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for their manifeſt Loyalty to the King, their Care,
Charge, and Vigilancy for the preſervation of his Majeſties Perſon and
the Proteſtant Religion: when his Majeſties Prerogative to call and
diſmiſs his Council, was queſtioned; and while they who infuſed fears
and groundleſs jealouſies of the Kings ruling by an Arbitrary power, did in
an Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary manner fine and impriſon divers of his Majeſties Loyal
Subjects. I doubt not to ſay, that though ſuch a petite venemous Inſect
as <hi>Achitophel</hi> was ſate on the Axle, and boaſted of his moving all
theſe great Wheels, yet there were many more than a few raſh and
deſperate perſons en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged<pb n="25" facs="tcp:53041:15"/>in the Commotion. And what
was the meaning of that Vote, <hi>That in caſe the King ſhould die by a
violent death, they would revenge it on the Papiſts,</hi> when the chief
Miniſters of State, the Biſhops, and all that were eminent for their
Loyalty, were condemned as being Popiſhly affected, and the Clergy branded as
Projectors for a Conjunction with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and had made
many ſteps towards it? Nor were theſe things whiſpered in a corner by
ſome Malecontents, but proclaimed on the houſe-top; they were <hi>vox &amp;
votum Populi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When <hi>Abſolon</hi> was ſacrificing at <hi>Hebron,</hi> the
Conſpiracy was <hi>ſtrengthened,</hi> ſays the Text, <hi>ch.</hi> 15. It
ſeems then <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolon</hi> had his Levites who ſet up their Altars at
<hi>Hebron,</hi> (which ſignifies a <hi>Society</hi> or
<hi>Aſſociation</hi>) in oppoſition to that at <hi>Hieruſalem;</hi> and
theſe were they that ſtrengthened the Rebellion. For as every Chieftain had
his Levite, ſo every Levite had ſome hundreds whoſe Purſes and
Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences were at their command; and inſtead of catechiſing them in
the duty of Obedience, they preached Satyrs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Governours, and
inſtilled the Doctrine of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance.</hi> Their Texts were
uſually ſuch as theſe: <hi>Ye take too much upon you, Moſes and Aaron;
all the congregation is holy every one of them, and the Lord is among
them,</hi> Numb. 16.3. <hi>Curſe ye Meroz,</hi> ſay theſe Angels of
Light, <hi>curſe ye bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly the inhabitants thereof, becauſe they came
not to help the Lord againſt the mighty,</hi> Judg. 5.23. <hi>Curſed be he
that doth the work of the Lord deceitfully,</hi> and <hi>curſed be he that
with-holds his ſword from bloud,</hi> Jer. 48.10. <hi>If ye do wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly, ye
ſhall be deſtroyed both you and your King,</hi> 1 Sam. 12.25. <hi>The kings
of the Gentiles exerciſe Lordſhip over them—but it ſhall not be
ſo with you,</hi> Mat. 20.25. <hi>He reproved kings for their ſakes;
ſaying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm,</hi> Pſal.
105.15. <hi>Stand faſt in the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty wherewith Chriſt hath made you free,
and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage,</hi> Gal. 5.1. <hi>In vain
do they worſhip me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men,</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:53041:16"/>Mat. 15.9. <hi>I hate them that hold lying</hi> (or
<hi>ſuperſtitious</hi>) <hi>vanities,</hi> Pſal. 31.6. <hi>Come out of
Babylon, my people, that ye partake not of her ſins, and that ye receive not
of her plagues,</hi> Rev. 18.4. <hi>The hour cometh, and now is, when the true
worſhippers ſhall worſhip the Father in ſpirit and in truth: for the
Father ſeeketh ſuch to worſhip him,</hi> Joh. 4.23. <hi>Why, as though
living in the world, are ye ſubject to ordinances? Touch not, taſt not,
handle not: which all are to periſh with the uſing, after the commandments
and doctrines of men,</hi> Col. 2.20. <hi>I thank thee, O Father, that thou
haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe and prudent, and haſt revealed them
unto babes,</hi> Mat. 11.25.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the Texts; and it is eaſie to conjecture what Uſes
and Applications were made to the People. For from theſe, the People are
inſtructed in their great Priviledges and Power: That there is Idolatry and
Superſtition in the Church, Oppreſſion and Tyranny in the State: That
they ought to ſhake off thoſe Yokes of Bondage, and <hi>vindicate
themſelves into the glorious liberty of the ſons</hi> and daughters <hi>of
God:</hi> That they may <hi>bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with
fetters of iron, to execute judgment upon them;</hi> for <hi>this honour have
all the Saints,</hi> Pſal. 149.8. Hence every Idiot thinks he underſtands
the Scriptures bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than his Prieſt or Biſhop. And <hi>the watchmen of
Iſrael</hi> may in vain forewarn them of the ſin and miſery which their
falſe Prophets are leading them to, though it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated, that as
naturally as the ſame cauſe doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the ſame effects, ſo do the
ſame ſeditious Principles ſpring up into rebellious Practices: which a
Prophet of their own was ſo ſenſible of, that he told thoſe men, that
they were <hi>nati ad bis perdendam Rempub. Anglicanam, Born to deſtroy the
Engliſh Government a ſecond time.</hi> But though <hi>an Angel from
Heaven,</hi> or <hi>one from the dead</hi> ſhould perſwade them contrary to
what their Teachers have infuſed into them, their Underſtandings are ſo
oblinded, and Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſeared, that ſooner may a Jew or a Turk be
converted from ſuch ſins, than a bigotted Separatiſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:53041:16"/>One tells the People, that they are the
Original of Civil Authority, and if Magiſtrates act not by the Laws,
<hi>(quas vulgus eligerit)</hi> they forfeit their Authority: Others, That it
is lawful for them to enter into Leagues and Covenants for defence of
themſelves and their Religion, without and againſt the Magiſtrates
command: That it is not againſt Scripture, or the practice of Primitive
Chriſtians, violently to reſiſt the Higher Powers, when they perſecute
them for Religion, or when the Prince commands againſt the Laws of the
Country: That Succeſs juſtifieth a Cauſe; and to purſue it, is to
comply with the Will of God, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Providence: That King
<hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully put to death, and his Murtherers
were the bleſſed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of Gods Glory in their Generation: That he
firſt made War on the Parliament, and therefore might not onely be
reſiſted, but ceaſed to be a King; and many that died in the War
againſt him, are glorious Saints in Heaven: That the Presbyterian Government
is that Scepter of Chriſt to which all the Kings of the Earth muſt bow, or
he will break them in pieces like a Potters Veſſel: That the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of
our Ceremonies was ſufficient to countervail for all the Bloud and Treaſure
ſpent and ſpilt in the late Wars.

and protection of <hi>Righteous and Religious States</hi> profeſſing his

preventing him with his Bleſſing; and when he foreſaw to what
diſtreſs his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies had reduced him, he heard the cry even before he

            <p>God ſhot one arrow of <hi>Infatuation</hi> among them; ſo that

kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Lord.</hi> Our firſt conſideration therefore ſhall be,
of the ſpecial Care and Providence of God over Kings and Governours: For if
we grant that God hath any reſpect to the Welfare of Mankind, we muſt
acknowledge it eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in his protection and ordaining of Rulers and
Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, without which no Society of men can ſubſiſt. Now of all
Governments, that which comes neareſt to the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty and Dominion of
God, hath moſt of his inſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and that is Monarchy, which he owns for
his Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution: <hi>By me Kings reign;</hi> and the Apoſtle calls it
<hi>his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance,</hi> Rom. 13. and therefore he muſt be worſe than a
Heathen, who denies a Special providence over Kings, when it reacheth <hi>every
man,</hi> yea, <hi>every ſparrow that falls to the ground.</hi> Hence God
owns them as ſtanding in a nearer relation to himſelf: They are <hi>his
Miniſters;</hi> his <hi>Shepherds,</hi> to protect and feed his flock; his
<hi>Vicegerents,</hi> to<pb n="33" facs="tcp:53041:19"/>
               <hi>bear the Sword for the
puniſhment of evil doers, and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of them that do well:</hi> They
have more of the Image of God, in Authority and Power to diſpenſe Favours
and Rewards, even to Life or Death. God calls them by his own Name, ſets them
in his Throne, and over <hi>his Kingdom,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 13.8. and
<hi>they that reſiſt, reſiſt the kingdom of God,</hi> and fight
againſt him. God calls them to a difficult and invidious work, ſuch as
<hi>Jethro</hi> ſaid <hi>was too heavy for Moſes himſelf,</hi> Exod.
18.18. and <hi>Solomon</hi> ſtarts at it with a <hi>Quis ſufficit? Who is
able to judge this ſo great people?</hi> 1 King. 3.9. They have as many
enemies as there are ſins and vices in the Nation; and the beſt Kings, that
are moſt diligent to reſtrain <hi>evil doers,</hi> have the moſt
adverſaries. If there be any national Judgements, any Invaſion from abroad,
any Tumults or Factions at home; if Fire or Famine, the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence or the
Sword afflict the Nation; if there be any Injuſtice or Oppreſſion in the
inferiour Magiſtrates, any Ambition or Emulation among the Nobles and Gentry,
any decay of Trade among the Commonalty, the burthen of all lieth on the King;
and the people are ready to cry out againſt their Governours, as the Heathen
did againſt the Chriſtians, <hi>Imperatores ad Leones.</hi> Of this burthen
<hi>David</hi> complains, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 75.3. <hi>The earth and all the
inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants thereof are diſſolved: I bear up the pillars thereof.</hi> By
reaſon of theſe diſorders, God is ſaid to have eſtabliſhed the
Kingdoms of the world <hi>on the flouds,</hi> and <hi>waves,</hi> which though
they often roar horribly, and lift up their voice, yet <hi>he hath ſet bounds
to them, and ſtilleth the raging of the waters and the madneſs of the
people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Circa perſonas pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licas, Specialis habitat
providentia.</note> Wherefore as God calls them to a more operoſe and
dangerous work, ſo he gives them proportionable helps and aſſiſtances;
for which he covenanted with <hi>David</hi> when he gave him the Kingdom: <hi>I
have found David my ſervant; with my holy oyl have I anointed him; with whom
my hand ſhall be eſtabliſhed, and my arm ſhall ſtrengthen him: the
ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my<pb n="34" facs="tcp:53041:20"/>ſhall not exact upon him, nor the ſon of
wickedneſs afflict him: I will beat down his foes before his face, and plague
them that hate him,</hi> Pſal. 89.20,21,22,23. And theſe were <hi>the
ſure mercies of David,</hi> which <hi>God that cannot lie</hi> did always
perform unto him: And when he doth the like to other good Kings, he fulfils his
own Covenant, and pleads his own Cauſe. Thus as the Heathen fancied every
King of the Nations had a God to be his Guardian <hi>(Mulciber in Trojam pro
Trojâ ſtabat Apollo:)</hi> ſo certainly every Prince, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
ſuch as defend the true Faith, have God for their Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor: and as
<hi>Phidias</hi>'s portraicture was ſo engraven in the Statue of
<hi>Minerva,</hi> that the Image of the Goddeſs was vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated with that of
her Workman; ſo the honour of God is reflected on by any injury offered to
the King. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God hath enjoyned, <hi>firſt of all, that prayers
ſupplications, and thankſgivings be made—for kings, and all that are
in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> 1 Tim. 2. So in the Old Teſtament, <hi>Prayers ſhall be
made for him, and daily ſhall he be praiſed,</hi> Pſal. 72.15. not
curſed and reproached.</p>
            <p>Therefore God hath given ſuch ſtrict Rules and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
concerning them, <hi>Not to ſpeak evil of dignities,</hi> for that is a kind
of Blaſphemy; <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſpeak evil of the rulers of the
people,</hi> Acts 23.5. Nor to hearken to any mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murings or diſcontent: for
ſuch <hi>murmurings</hi> are not <hi>againſt them,</hi> ſo much as
<hi>againſt the Lord,</hi> who choſe them to that Office. Not to ſcatter
falſe reports, and create fears and jealouſies, whereby the affections of
the Subjects may be alienated from their Prince; 
<note place="margin">Excordem reddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, &amp; amentem
populum.</note> for that were as <hi>Abſolon,</hi> to <hi>ſteal the hearts
of the people;</hi> which is not onely to take the <hi>Crown from his
head,</hi> but in effect (as we have ſeen) <hi>his Head from his
Shoulders,</hi> and to leave the Body of the people as a Carkas fit onely to be
devoured by Birds and Beaſts of prey.</p>
            <p>And as the Laws are ſtrict, ſo the Sanctions to enforce
thoſe Laws are ſo ſevere, that no wit of men, though all
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:53041:20"/>the Kings of the earth ſhould conſult together, can
either preſcribe better Laws, or oblige their Subjects to obedience under
ſuch penalties: for 'tis not the King onely that exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutes Wrath and
Vengeance on the Diſobedient, and, as <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 17.11.
<hi>ſends a cruel meſſenger</hi> to them that contrive Rebellion; but God
hath threatned that <hi>they that reſiſt ſhall receive to themſelves
damnation,</hi> Rom. 13. which is certainly to be underſtood of eternal
Damnation, as due to this as to any other ſin, this being one of the firſt
magnitude, and the cauſe of an infinite number of other ſins: and no leſs
a penalty, in the judgment of all Divines, would be effectual to affright men
from any beloved Luſt: And therefore I preſent this as another wiſe
conſideration, to ſuch as are tempted to this Impiety. And now I may
infallibly conclude from theſe premiſes, that as ſurely as
<hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitophel</hi>'s Counſel and <hi>Abſolon</hi>'s Rebellion was from
Satan, ſo was the contrivance and practice of our Late Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors from
the ſame evil Spirit; and the Kings Deliverance from God, as ſure as
<hi>Davids</hi> was, <hi>Qui facit mirabilia magna ſolus, who onely doth
great and marvelous works,</hi> and doth them in ſuch a manner, that they
<hi>ought to be had in ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting remembrance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A ſecond conſideration may be this: Gods hand is moſt
evidently ſeen in thoſe Actions that make moſt for his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and for
thoſe ends for which he hath eſtabliſhed Rule and Government in the
World, i. e. <hi>that under it we may lead quiet and peaceable lives in all
godlineſs and honeſty.</hi> And as theſe ends are generally attained
under Religious Princes, ſo if they ſhould periſh untimely and violently,
no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Diſorder and Confuſion would follow; as it was with
<hi>Iſrael</hi> of old, and with us in later days, when <hi>There was no king
in Iſrael, every one did what ſeemed right in his own eyes.</hi> If this
prodigious Deſigne had ſucceeded, God ſhould have been entituled the
Author of it, and be mock'd with a Thankſgiving-day for the ſucceſs; the
Actors had been honoured as Patriots and Saints: the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:53041:21"/>had by theſe <hi>true Proteſtants</hi> received another
inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Blot, and the true Proteſtant been rendred more odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than the
moſt treacherous Papiſts, or thoſe Hungari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans that fight under the Great
Turk againſt Chriſtianity; Hereſie, Hypocriſie, and Regicide, been made
the publick Profeſſion and Religion of the Nation. But <hi>God is not the
Author of</hi> ſuch <hi>Confuſions:</hi> He hath by this Diſcovery
vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated his own Glory, and the eſtabliſhed Religion and Government
among us; and if our ſinful Ingratitude do not ſeparate between God and us,
he will do it to the end of the World.</p>
            <p>Theſe things ought <hi>wiſely</hi> to be laid to heart by
every ſerious Chriſtian: therefore <hi>thus ſaith the Lord, I do not this
for your ſakes, O houſe of Iſrael, but for my holy Names ſake, which ye
have prophaned among the heathen,</hi> and—<hi>that the heathen may know
that I am the Lord when I ſhall be ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in you before their
eyes,</hi> Ezek. 36.22. And God grant that what follows in that Prophet may be
found among us, <hi>That God may put his Spirit within us, and cauſe us to
walk in his Statutes, and keep his Judgments, and do them,</hi> that we may
dwell in the Land that he gave unto our Fathers; <hi>and we may be his people,
and he our God,</hi> Ezek. 11.23. <hi>And</hi> then, <hi>though</hi> (as
<hi>Iſay</hi> ſaith) <hi>our enemies aſſociate themſelves, they
ſhall be broken in pieces; though they gird themſelves</hi> (to battel)
<hi>they ſhall be broken in pieces; though they take coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel together, it
ſhall come to nought: for God is with us,</hi> Iſai. 8.9,10.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Again, let us <hi>conſider wiſely,</hi> that
in this wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Deliverance there appeared no other Agent or Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
but Gods immediate and out-ſtretched Arm, working Deliverance for us, not by
means, but without and againſt means; by contrary means, even by the ſame
that would have deſtroyed us: <hi>Not by force, nor by might, but by my
Spirit, ſaith the Lord: it was not our Sword nor our Bow, but it was God that
ſaved us from our Enemies, and put them to confuſion that hated us.</hi> By
this we may know that <hi>it is<pb n="37" facs="tcp:53041:21"/>God alone, and beſide him
there is no Saviour:</hi> When he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands and creates Deliverances, and we
are ſaved <hi>ſo as by fire,</hi> by the very means that would have
deſtroyed us; he muſt be blind that cannot ſee it; and may he be dumb,
that will not ſay, <hi>This hath God done.</hi> And <hi>Qui ſolus in
O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pere, ſit ſolus in Laude.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Let us <hi>wiſely conſider</hi> that God
ſaved us in the very inſtant of Danger, pluckt us out of the very Jaws of
Death, and <hi>as fire-brands</hi> (fit indeed to be conſumed) <hi>out of the
fire;</hi> when <hi>Horae momento Cita Mors:</hi> when we were brought to the
brink of a Sea of Bloud, and <hi>Pharoah</hi> and his Hoſt purſuing us, and
crying <hi>Victoria,</hi> that then God ſhould <hi>divide the waters,</hi>
and make a ſafe paſſage for us, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm our Enemies, and the
<hi>Cita Mors</hi> was made a <hi>Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria laeta; this was,</hi> Deo vindice
Nodus, <hi>the Lords doing, and is marvellous in our eyes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> When ſuch ſtrange and unexpected
Deliverances are often repeated, and God appears to us not once or twice, as he
did to <hi>Solomon,</hi> but as often as he did to <hi>David,</hi> ſaving him
from <hi>the Lion and the Bear,</hi> and <hi>the uncircumciſed
Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtins,</hi> and from the Sword of <hi>Saul,</hi> and the Counſel of
<hi>Achi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tophel,</hi> and the Rebellion of <hi>Abſolon,</hi> and from the
hands of <hi>all his Enemies;</hi> may not <hi>David</hi> conclude, <hi>By this
I know that thou favoureſt me, becauſe mine enemies do not triumph over
me?</hi> Pſal. 41.11. 
<note place="margin">Raro futilibus micat ignibus aether.</note> And
when God ſhall uſher in a Prince into the World by the unuſual
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of a Star at Noon, and lead him through a tedious Wilderneſs by a
Pillar of a Cloud, to hide him from his Enemies, and guide him by a Pillar of
Fire out of their Snares; when he not onely keeps his heart upright amidſt
almoſt invincible temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to Idolatry and Superſtition, but <hi>covers
his head in the day of battel,</hi> and at laſt with a <hi>non
obſtante,</hi> ſets him to reign <hi>as a king upon his holy hill of
Sion,</hi> to defend his true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to execute Judgment and Juſtice
to all his People: They muſt be more obdurate than <hi>Pharoah,</hi> and more
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe<pb n="38" facs="tcp:53041:22"/>than his Magicians, that will not confeſs
<hi>digitus Dei hic,</hi> the hand of the Lord is in all this; that God hath
<hi>mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified the king in the ſight of all the people,</hi> as he did
<hi>Joſhua, Joſh.</hi> 3.7. and <hi>made his glory great</hi> in ſuch
Salvations, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 21.5.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> We may alſo <hi>wiſely conſider</hi> that
<hi>David</hi> himſelf made no uſe of any other Weapon againſt
<hi>Achitophel,</hi> but a ſhort Prayer, and his conſtant truſt and
confidence in the power and goodneſs of God. You have his Prayer,
<hi>ch.</hi> 15.31. <hi>O Lord, I beſeech thee, turn the counſel of
Achitophel into fooliſhneſs:</hi> and the Prayer of this <hi>righteous
man</hi> was more effectual than Chariots and Horſemen, for there is a
certain Omnipotency in Prayer: <hi>Concerning the works of my hands</hi> (any
thing that God can do) <hi>command ye me,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>Iſai.</hi>
45.11. and <hi>whatever we ask according to the will of God, we know that he
heareth us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this being Gods expreſs Will and Command, that <hi>firſt
of all, prayers, ſupplications, interceſſions, and giving of thanks, be
made for kings and all that are in authority,</hi> &amp;c. it ſhould endear
the uſe of Liturgy unto us, and cauſe us in full aſſurance of Faith to
put up our Requeſts to God, that he would <hi>abate the Pride, aſſwage
the Malice, and confound the Devices</hi> of all the Kings Enemies: That he
would <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſh him with the Grace of his Holy Spirit, that he may
al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way incline to Gods Will, and walk in his way;</hi> that he would <hi>grant
him in Health and Wealth long to live;</hi> that he would <hi>ſtrengthen him
that he may vanquiſh and overcome all his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; and finally, after this
life he may obtain everlaſting Joy and Felicity:</hi> That <hi>thoſe Evils
which the craft and ſubtilty of the Devil or man works againſt us, may be
brought to nought; and by the providence of his goodneſs they may be
diſperſed, that we may be hurt by no perſecutions; but being armed with
his defence, may be preſerved evermore from all perils, to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie him who
is the giver of all victory, through the merits of Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.
With ſuch ſacrifices God is well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; this is good and acceptable in
the ſight of God our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,</hi>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:53041:22"/>1 Tim. 2.3. And
<hi>bleſſed be God who hath not turned away his face from us, nor our
Prayers from him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Let me perſwade all thoſe whoſe hearts
the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of <hi>Achitophel,</hi> and ſubtile Inſinuations of
<hi>Abſolon,</hi> had <hi>ſtollen</hi> from their King, wiſely to
conſider what in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability would have been the conſequences of this
Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy if it had ſucceeded. All wiſe men do propoſe ſome
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent advantages and proſperous ends to themſelves. I demand therefore,
if the fatal Blow had been given, what proſpect could they have but of
Confuſion and Miſery in ſuch ways? what though <hi>David</hi> had been
ſet on when weak and weary handed? yet, as <hi>Huſſai</hi> ſaid, 2
<hi>Sam.</hi> 17.8. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s men were <hi>mighty men,</hi> and would
not have died as Cowards, tamely yielding their throats to thoſe Butchers;
but being <hi>chafed in their minds,</hi> would have purſued the Murtherers,
<hi>as a Bear robbed of her Whelps:</hi> and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try was not yet ſecured
to <hi>Abſolon,</hi> for which cauſe he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the Counſel of
<hi>Achitophel</hi> as raſh and dangerous. But ſuppoſe they had
maſſacred not onely <hi>David</hi> and his Guards, but a thouſand of the
Loyal Nobility, Gentry, and Clergy; ſome thouſands alſo of the
Rebel-Party might have periſhed in the Attempt, and <hi>Achitophel</hi> and
<hi>Abſolon</hi> been cut off in the head of them: then he among the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that had the longeſt Sword, would have ſet up for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and they that
had joyntly acted Treaſon againſt their King, would have avenged his Bloud
by turning their Swords one againſt another; and executed the vengeance of
God upon themſelves, when there was no Power or Authority of men to do
it.</p>
            <p>And if all things had fallen out to their expectation, if they had
<hi>killed and taken poſſeſſion,</hi> and divided the <hi>Spoil, to
every man a Damoſel or two,</hi> beſide the Houſes of God, the Portion of
the Prieſts, and the Kings Lands; they might have had as ſhort an enjoyment
of their Prey, as <hi>Siſera</hi>'s Captain, which was but during the Dream
of ſome <hi>ſilly women,</hi> Judg. 5.30. or God himſelf would have
<hi>driven a<pb n="40" facs="tcp:53041:23"/>nail through their temples,</hi> and bereaved
them of the ſenſe of their ſin or miſery, that, as Regicides generally
have done, they would have lived and died impenitently, and ſo pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed
eternally: And this probably had been their portion, whether they were
defeated, or had ſucceeded; which I wiſh they were ſo wiſe as
ſeriouſly to conſider, and lay it to heart. As alſo, that having
brought the Nation into ſo great Diſtraction and Confuſion, while they
were violently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to divide the Prey among themſelves, how eaſily
they might be made a Prey to a forreign Enemy, who need no other advantage to
ſwallow us up, than our being thus divided and cut in pieces by our ſelves:
Then Prince, and Prieſt, and People, might have made their Enemies Swords
drunk with Bloud; or if they had eſcaped that, might have wandered up and
down begging their Bread in deſolate places: or if this had not happened, a
perpetual Civil War might have been intailed on the Nation, one Party ſtill
ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planting another; Armies kept up by the ſeveral Factions; and the poor
Labourers muſt have fed thoſe Vulturs with their own Vitals: they muſt
have partaken of their Sins too, as well as of their Oppreſſions; they
muſt have been taught to <hi>blaſpheme God</hi> as well as the
<hi>King:</hi> there would have been no Neuters, but all Actives or
Paſſives, to mock God with Thankſgiving for their own Miſery, &amp;
<hi>faſt for Strife and Debate;</hi> to violate their Oaths and Vows, or to
yield themſelves a Sacrifice to the Rage of their Enemies. Now when this
abominable Deſolation is prevented, and God hath preſerved Order, Peace,
and Truth, Juſtice and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, ſo that every man may <hi>ſit
under his own vine,</hi> and eat the Fruits of that, and of Gods Vine alſo
which he hath planted in the midſt of us; he muſt be an incarnate Devil
that ſhall repine at ſuch Bleſſings, and pine away in his
Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities.</p>
            <p>As for us, let our hearts be filled with Joy, and our mouths with
Praiſe: <hi>Let the king rejoyce in God his Saviour, and all that ſwear by
him</hi> (all the <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that have kept
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:53041:23"/>their Allegiance,) <hi>put their truſt in God: for the
mouth of them that ſpeak lies</hi> (and ſwallow Perjuries) <hi>ſhall be
ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,</hi> Pſal. 63.11. And indeed, God hath done that for us, which
all the Wiſdom and Learning, the Laws and Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Nation, could not
do. In vain have we endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to confute their Fanatick Opinions and
Doctrines, which in vain have been confuted an hundred times: This one act of
God, that hath pluckt off the hood from theſe Hypocrites, and diſcovered
their inward parts to be very wickedneſs, and ſhewn us what they are <hi>by
their fruits,</hi> is an argument beyond any demonſtration of
<hi>Euclid,</hi> to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the world, that <hi>under the Sheeps
clothing</hi> they were as ſo many <hi>Wolves ravening</hi> for the innocent
bloud both of Sheep and Shepherds: but <hi>(Pan curat oves, oviumque
Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtros)</hi> God hath pluckt us out of their teeth.</p>
            <p>And now there wants but one Parallel more, to compleat our
deliverance, and perpetuate our happineſs; and that is, <hi>wiſely to
conſider,</hi> with <hi>David, quod retribuam Domino,</hi> what returns we
ought to make to God for all the benefits that he hath done unto us. Good
<hi>Mephiboſeth</hi> was ready <hi>to part with all</hi> when the King was
returned to his houſe in peace. We cannot now <hi>ſacrifice to our own
nets,</hi> to our own ſtrength, or wiſdom, or merit: O let us not do it to
our own Luſts, to Intemperance and Exceſs, to carnal Secrity and
Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitence; nor to Malice and Revenge againſt any thing but thoſe ſins
which <hi>war againſt God and our own ſouls,</hi> and had brought us ſo
nigh to a ſudden death, and to everlaſting deſtruction; but let us
<hi>wiſely conſider</hi> the opportunities of <hi>knowing</hi> and
<hi>doing,</hi> in this our day of mercy, <hi>the things that belong to our
peace:</hi> For God hath as many miraculous ways and methods to deſtroy us,
as he hath hitherto manifeſted to preſerve us. Eſpecially let us guard
our ſelves againſt thoſe ſins which had a more direct tendency to this
accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed deſign; the ſins of Ambition and Diſcontent, of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring
and repining againſt, and <hi>ſpeaking evil</hi> of our Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, of having
<hi>itching ears</hi> after new Doctrines and ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing<pb n="42" facs="tcp:53041:24"/>Spirits, though they appear as Angels of light. The two hundred men
that went to <hi>Hebron</hi> with <hi>Abſolon,</hi> went <hi>in the
ſimplicity of their hearts;</hi> they were told onely of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing and
Feaſting, of performing religious Vows and Covenants, and ſerving God in a
better and freer manner than they could do at <hi>Hieruſalem;</hi> and there
indeed they might find <hi>all the elders of Iſrael</hi> conſulting with
<hi>Abſolon</hi> and <hi>Achitophel,</hi> Ch. 17.4. and voting for them; and
hear <hi>Achitophel</hi> pray <hi>Extempore</hi> as readily as any Modern
En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſt: for the Rabbins report of him, that he had a new Prayer for
every day in the year; and there they were rapt with admiration at the
Declamations of <hi>Abſolon,</hi> whereby he harangu'd the people,
ſpreading before them the miſcarriages in his Fathers Government, and
promiſing them a redreſs of all their Grievances, and reſtoring them to
their ancient Priviledges of the people of God: there they had Prieſts
alſo, who being accuſtomed to the ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of bloud, taught them that
they might ſlay ſuch as <hi>had their faces ſet towards
Hieruſalem,</hi> with the ſame zeal and opinion of doing God ſervice, as
they could kill an Ox for Sacrifice. And though the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were
by nature cruel enough, yet the Doctrine of theſe men, like thoſe of the
Phariſees, made them <hi>threefold more the children of wrath,</hi> malice,
and cruelty, than they were. An ill Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it is, certainly, that transforms
Men into Beaſts, and a Flock of Lambs into a Den of Lyons: but this ſome
ſuch Doctrines as I have mentioned can do.</p>
            <p>Take heed therefore of leaving the eſtabliſhed Worſhip at
<hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> for the Conventicles at <hi>Hebron:</hi> you know
<hi>how great a matter a little fire kindleth,</hi> when it is blown up from
beneath. When the People had been a little while at <hi>Hebron,</hi> they could
not return; but having gone ſo far, muſt go a little farther, and
proclaim—<hi>Abſolon reigneth in Hebron,</hi> and then they muſt
follow him from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles to the Camp, and ingage in a Battel againſt
<hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> to their ruine and deſtruction. Let us learn to be
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:53041:24"/>wiſe and ſober, from the effects of their folly and
madneſs: Let us <hi>ſtudy to be quiet, and to do our own buſineſs,</hi>
not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with things that are above us; But, as <hi>Soloman</hi>
advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, <hi>My ſon, fear thou God and the King, and meddle not with them
that are given to change: for their calamity ſhall riſe ſuddenly, and who
knoweth the ruine of them both?</hi> Prov. 24.21.</p>
